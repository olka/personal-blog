      <description>Performance characteristics of Random, ThreadLocalRandom and SplittableRandom Preface Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve got interesting task related to random data generation and writing this data on disk as fast as possible using Java. Unfortunately performance requirements were really tight: in peak application should support writing at ~3 Gb/s. Which means that it should generate random data at really high pace, encode it to proper charset and finally write to disk. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty much an exposition and motivation behind following measurements and why it was so important to dig in.</description>

      <description>Raspberry Pi vs Tinker Board: node.js performance Preface Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve bought both Raspberry Pi and Tinker Board to experiment with microservices performance, cause in the cloud you never know how busy your host is. As an application under test I&amp;rsquo;ve found just perfect match - Dockerised Microservices Calculator by Jeremy Cook written on node.js. It&amp;rsquo;s dockerised microservices calculator that has been designed to evaluate simple and complex mathematical expressions with any valid user provided expression using the order of operations (or operator precedence) rules.</description>
